# Mini Frontend E-Commerce for iPhones

## Overview

This is a **mini frontend e-commerce app** designed to sharpen my skills in **JavaScript**, **DOM manipulation**, and **CSS styling**.  
It simulates core online store interactions but is purely frontend no backend or real transactions involved.

### Key focus areas:

- Mastering the **DOM API** for dynamic page updates  
- Structuring HTML into logical sections  
- Styling with **CSS** for a clean, responsive layout  
- Managing app state with **localStorage** for data persistence  

---

## Features

- **Color selection**  
  Switch between iPhone colors, updating product images and backgrounds dynamically.

 <img src="iphone2.png" alt="iPhone" width="480" /> 

- **Shopping cart**  
  - Add and remove items  
  - Cart state saved in `localStorage` to persist across reloads  
  - Product icons reflect cart status

- **Product details persistence**  
  Stores product name, image, and price in `localStorage`.

- **Contact panel toggle**  
  Show/hide contact icons for Viber, WhatsApp, and phone.

- CSS3  
- JavaScript (ES6): event listeners, DOM traversal, dynamic element creation, `localStorage` management

## Purpose

This is a learning project, not production-ready. It helped me:

- Break down UI into functional components  
- Deepen understanding of DOM events and manipulation  
- Build clean, maintainable JavaScript for real UI features

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repo.  
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.  
3. Explore: change colors, manage cart, submit ratings, simulate orders.
